                      Mark Albert Jeffries, aka DiLisio (formerly Fly.), was raised on rock 'n roll. It's so in his
                      bloodstream that, like many music snobs, he developed very distinct tastes early on for what he
                      thought was good and what wasn't. And after 27 years of simply being a fan of The Black Keys and 
                      Led Zeppelin, he decided it was time to take whatever songwriting skills he possessed at the time 
                      and make a rock album. Not realizing that the genres he thought were "bad" growing up (namely 
                      hip-hop) contributed mightily to the creation of his first record. Aging with grace. That is the 
                      heart of Jeffries, and his music, in a nutshell.

                      Recorded in 2017 and now being re-released under a new moniker, Pittsburgh-based DiLisio's
                      debut EP "She Will Like the Science" encompasses everything that he loves about blues-rock. 
                      Swampy guitar riffs, nuanced drumming by friend and frequent collaborator Garrett Grube (O'Hara, 
                      Allegra, Single Jo), soulful organ, syncopated vocal delivery, and heartbreaking lyrics about 
                      love, depression, and second chances.

                      Following up his stage-name change was the release of his cry-for-help single 'Homebody' in Oct
                      '19. Armed with simply his acoustic, harp, and voice, this original folk song is full of the same
                      aching soul possessed by John Prine, Neil Young, and all the great singer-songwriters of the past 
                      and present. DiLisio encompasses a sound that he describes as "cosmic chaos", with even more 
                      cosmically-chaotic new releases on the way in early 2020.
